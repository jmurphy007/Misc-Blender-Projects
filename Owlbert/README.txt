Owlbert

For fun one day, I decided to recreate the staff used in the Disney show The Owl House.

It was my first attempt recreating something in Blender using a reference image to try to shape the details correctly.

I had also made this to potentially have 3D printed to be life size and to give one to a close friend of mine.
