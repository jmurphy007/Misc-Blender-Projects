TableBottleProject

This was a project for my Blender class. We were just learning animations and our assignment was to create an animation of a bottle falling off a table.
I decided to give a reason for the bottle falling, with a baseball breaking a window, knocking it into a TV, and shattering.

This was another project where I got a random, crazy idea that had more work than needed, but I went with it anyway to try to create something enjoyable and funny.
