Wii Bowling

This was for my final project for my Blender class. 
We were split into groups and were able to create any animated scene we desired.
My group and I thought it would be funny to recreate bowling from Nintendo's Wii Sports when you fail to launch the ball correctly.

I was in charge of the project. I created the Mii models, the animations, the bowling lane gutters, as well as piecing everyone's contributions together.
One group member, my friend Eric, created the scoreboards and walls in the scene.
Another group member, Daniela, created the bowling ball and pins.
The last group memnber created the floor for the bowling alley.

Due to the very large file size, the files had to be heavily compressed using 7Zip. If anyone has any trouble accessing it, please let me know.
