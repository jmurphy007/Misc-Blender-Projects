Person

This is another personal project of mine. I had come up with a game idea involving a martial artist and wanted to attempt to make the character model.
I based the design off of my personal experience when I learned Tae Kwon Do. 
I taught myself the cloth simulation in Blender and tried to make it as realistic as possible.
It will just be the first version of this model, I do hope to improve it and make it able to be used in my game idea soon.
