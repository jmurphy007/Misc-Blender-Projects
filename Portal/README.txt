Portal

This was for another assignment for my Unity class. The finished assignment will be in the Unity folder.

We needed to create a scene in Unity using the first bunch of tools we learned. 
So I chose to try to recreate the first chamber from Valve's game Portal.
It is one of my favorite video games, and one of the games that made me want to learn how to create my own video games.
These are some of the model assets I made in Blender for the assignment.
